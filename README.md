# VirtualEnigmaMachine
Enigma machine that should provide the same answer as the real thing (same rotors and everything) in MatLab.

Two options to run (both in MatLab)
  - NO GUI: 
  Open VirtualEnigmaSource, and run it. 
    It will prompt you to input a message in all caps, with no punctuation (or space). Do include quotation marks.
        Example: 'HELLOWORLD'
    You can edit Enigma parameters in the code itself (starting line 25)
    
  - With a GUI: 
    Once you are in the correct directory, run type
      guide
    in the command prompt. You'll be prompted to open VirtualEngimaMachineGUI.fig. 
    Then click the green triangle (Run Figure) in the top bar or press Ctrl+T.
    The GUI should be ready to use. Be sure to use all caps and no space or punctuation (like they did it back in the day)
